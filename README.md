# JavaScript-Password-Generator
This project involved the creation of a random password generator. This password generator allows the user to choose whether to have numeric, uppcase, lowercase, and special character items included in the password. Once it runs, it creates the desired password as output for the user.

This password generator could be used in a variety of settings: for personal use to generate passwords, or even corporate use for employees, as well as general use for websites to provide to users, etc.
